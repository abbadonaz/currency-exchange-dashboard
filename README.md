# 💱 Currency Exchange Dashboard

An educational machine learning project that explores anomaly detection in currency exchange rates using algorithms such as **Isolation Forest**.

This repository includes both the **dashboard implementation** and links to my **learning notes**, which document the process.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built with: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas  
- Core algorithms: Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection in exchange rate data)  
- Purpose: Educational — combining practical coding with structured ML learning.

## 📝 Learning Notes

As part of this project, I documented my learning journey using **NotebookLM**.  
These notes explain key machine learning algorithms and their applications.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Parts of the learning notes were **generated with the assistance of NotebookLM** and then curated by me.  
They are included here to **showcase my personal learning process** — not as finalized research material.
